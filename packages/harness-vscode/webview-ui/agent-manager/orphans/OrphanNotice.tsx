/**
 * Warning banner for leftover folders under `.harness/worktrees/` that no git worktree claims.
 *
 * Deleting files is never automatic, so the only action here is opening `OrphanDialog` — the banner
 * itself only ever names how many there are and their total size. Size is asynchronous (a background
 * fs walk), so it is shown once every orphan's size has landed and a calculating affordance is shown
 * until then rather than a wrong or stale number.
 *
 * Three states, not two: a folder the host could not walk never reports a size, so once the pass has
 * settled without covering everything the banner drops the size and says how many folders there are.
 * Treating that as "still calculating" left the affordance up forever.
