/**
 * Webview-side diff scope state for Agent Manager.
 *
 * Mirrors the extension's composite diff id (`ctx#scope`, or `ctx#session:<sid>`
 * for the session scope — see `src/agent-manager/diff-scope.ts`) and builds the
 * fixed scope descriptor list shown in the scope selector. The context is the
 * sidebar selection (a worktree id or the `local` pseudo-context), so it stays
 * stable across session tab switches; only the Session scope follows the active
 * session. Agent Manager always offers the same four scopes per context, so the
 * descriptors are computed client-side rather than pushed from the extension.
