/**
 * Reconciles the three views of a worktree that drift apart over time: the row in
 * `.harness/agent-manager.json`, the entry in `git worktree list`, and the directory on disk.
 *
 * Drift is normal — users delete worktrees by hand, `git worktree prune` runs elsewhere, branches
 * get deleted after a merge. What is not acceptable is polling paths that cannot answer, reporting
 * a failed probe as an empty diff, or claiming git is missing because a directory is.
 *
 * Metadata is the only thing this module ever mutates, and only in the one case where nothing can
 * be lost: the directory is gone, the branch is gone, and no session refers to it. Everything else
 * is classified, reported, and left for the user to act on. No file is ever deleted here.
 *
 * Pure orchestration — no vscode imports, all IO injected.
