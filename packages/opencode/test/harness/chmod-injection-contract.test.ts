/**
 * Contract test for chmod(0o000) failure injections in harness-sessions.test.ts.
 *
 * The heartbeat self-heal test breaks git with `chmod 0o000 .git` and asserts
 * the repository metadata disappears. On Windows chmod(0o000) is a no-op for
 * reads, and root ignores permission bits, so the injection cannot break git
 * there and the assertions spuriously fail. The file runs on Windows because
 * .github/workflows/test.yml schedules six windows shards that run the
 * packages/opencode unit tests with no exclusion. Every injection must skip
 * win32 and root first — the pattern in test/util/filesystem.test.ts
 * ("throws EACCES on permission-denied symlink target"). This test catches a
 * guard that was removed or copied without.
