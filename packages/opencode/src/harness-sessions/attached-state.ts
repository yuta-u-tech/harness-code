// Concurrency invariant: `lastSentKey` is the union the relay last observed
// through a successfully completed heartbeat. It is updated:
//   - synchronously by `setPresence` (fire-and-forget, but the union we

//     so a later `setPresence` with the same union correctly skips)
//   - by `announce` only on a successful awaited heartbeat AND only when
//     the announce still belongs to the current lifecycle (the captured
//     `myGeneration` matches the current `generation`)
// It is NEVER updated on:
//   - the synchronous prefix of `announce` (would let a concurrent
//     `setPresence` skip its heartbeat because the cache falsely claims the
//     relay is up to date, leaving the relay desynced if the announce then
//     fails)
//   - the failure branch of `announce` (the relay never saw the new union,
//     and a concurrent setPresence may have already advanced lastSentKey to
//     a newer state via its own fire-and-forget heartbeat)
//   - a stale success after `reset()` (the relay's observed state belongs
//     to the old lifecycle; the new lifecycle's setPresence calls must
//     drive the new baseline, not a stale overwrite)
