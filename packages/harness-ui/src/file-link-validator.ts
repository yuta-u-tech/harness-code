// This is intentionally a module-level singleton, not per-component state:
// - Virtualized transcripts unmount/remount TextPartDisplay instances as rows
//   scroll in and out of the overscan buffer. A per-component cache would be
//   discarded and rebuilt on every remount, repeating filesystem checks for
//   unchanged completed history. A module-level cache survives remounts.
// - Multiple mounted rows can reference the same path concurrently (e.g. a
//   file mentioned more than once in a transcript). Without shared in-flight
//   tracking each row would issue its own redundant validateFiles request.
//
// Requests for the same session are coalesced into one batch per microtask
// tick, so many candidates validated back-to-back in the same animation
// frame (as MutationObserver-driven passes do) become a single round trip.

// map means that churn evicts only other negatives — a confirmed clickable file
// never gets pushed out by non-file probe noise — and eviction stays O(1).

 * not be confirmed (e.g. every retry timed out) — callers should treat
 * `undefined` as "leave as-is", not as a negative result.
 *
 * `opts` tunes retry/TTL behavior. Note the config is per-batch: the first
 * caller to open a per-tick batch for a session fixes the config for that
 * batch, so callers batched into the same microtask tick share one config.
 * Production callers omit `opts` and rely on DEFAULTS; `opts` exists for tests.
