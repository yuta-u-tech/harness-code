## Product Context

Harness Code is an open source AI coding agent platform. It ships as a CLI and editor clients that all build on the same backend. This package (`packages/harness-vscode/`) is the **VS Code extension**.

### Products and How They Relate

All products are thin clients over the **CLI** (`packages/opencode/`, published as `@harness/cli`). The CLI is a fork of upstream [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) with Harness-specific additions (gateway auth, telemetry, migration, code review, branding). It contains the full AI agent runtime, tool execution, session management, provider integrations (500+ models), and an HTTP API server.

The VS Code extension spawns or connects to a `harness serve` process and communicates via HTTP REST + SSE using the auto-generated `@harness/sdk`. CLI clients can also use in-process transports, as shown below.

```

|---|---|---|---|
| Harness CLI (TUI) | `packages/opencode/` | Interactive terminal UI (SolidJS + OpenTUI) | In-process — TUI and server run together |
| Harness CLI (`harness run`) | `packages/opencode/` | Non-interactive headless mode for scripting | In-process — no network socket |
| **Harness VS Code Extension** | **`packages/harness-vscode/`** | VS Code extension with sidebar chat + Agent Manager | Bundles CLI binary, spawns `harness serve --port 0` as child process |

## Commands

```bash
bun run extension                  # Build + launch VS Code with the extension in dev mode
bun run extension:isolated         # Build + launch with persistent isolated IDE + Harness state
bun run extension:isolated:clean   # Clear isolated state, then build + launch
bun run compile                    # Type-check + lint + build
bun run watch                      # Watch mode (esbuild + tsc)
bun run test                       # Run tests (requires pretest compilation)
bun run lint                       # ESLint on src/
bun run format                     # Run formatter (do this before committing to avoid styling-only changes in commits)
```

The `extension` commands also work from the repo root. When a user asks to run an isolated VS Code/Harness environment, prefer the CLI scripts: `bun run extension:isolated` reuses `.harness-dev/`, while `bun run extension:isolated:clean` clears `.harness-dev/` before launching. Pass an optional workspace path after `--`, for example `bun run extension:isolated -- ../sample-project`. Pass `--insiders` to prefer VS Code Insiders, `--workspace PATH` to open a different folder, `--clean` to wipe cached state, or `--wait` to block until VS Code closes. VS Code is auto-detected on macOS, Linux, and Windows; override with `--app-path` or `VSCODE_EXEC_PATH`.

From this package: `bun run typecheck` checks host and webview types; `bun run test:unit` runs Bun unit tests. For a focused Agent Manager example, use `bun test tests/unit/agent-manager-arch.test.ts`.

Single VS Code integration test: `bun run test -- --grep "test name"`

## CLI Binary

The extension bundles its own CLI binary at `bin/harness` — it does NOT use a system-installed CLI. To build it:

```bash
bun script/local-bin.ts
```

Or use `--force` to rebuild:

```bash
bun script/local-bin.ts --force
```

The script checks for a prebuilt binary in `packages/opencode/dist/`, builds the CLI if needed, and copies it to `bin/harness`.

## Architecture

### Extension ↔ CLI Backend

The extension is a client of the CLI. Activation creates one shared `HarnessConnectionService`; on its first connection, which autocomplete may prewarm, `ServerManager` spawns `bin/harness serve --port 0`, captures the dynamically assigned port from stdout, and communicates over HTTP + SSE. The current child process is reused unless it exits. A random password is generated and passed via `HARNESS_SERVER_PASSWORD` env var for basic auth.

```
Extension (Node.js)                          CLI Backend (child process)

│   ├── ServerManager      │                │   HTTP REST API      │
│   ├── HttpClient         │                │   SSE event stream   │
│   └── SSEClient          │                │   Session management │
│                          │                │   AI agent runtime   │
│ HarnessProvider (sidebar)   │                └──────────────────────┘
│ HarnessProvider (agent mgr) │
│ HarnessProvider (open tabs) │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

- **`HarnessConnectionService`** (`src/services/cli-backend/connection-service.ts`) is created once during extension activation and shared across the sidebar, Harness editor tabs, and Agent Manager. It owns the current server process, HTTP client, and SSE connection.
- **`ServerManager`** (`src/services/cli-backend/server-manager.ts`) lazily spawns the CLI binary, reuses its current process, and can start a replacement if that process exits.
- The sidebar, every **Open in Tab** Harness panel, and the Agent Manager chat provider reuse this connection. Multiple **`HarnessProvider`** instances subscribe to it, with SSE events filtered per-webview via a `trackedSessionIds` Set. Agent Manager terminals may use additional PTY/WebSocket channels to the same backend, not separate `harness serve` processes.
- Backend state follows where it is allocated, not the worktree shown in a panel. Snapshot repository state uses directory-keyed `InstanceState`, while `trackState` is created once in the active Snapshot service closure. For these shared VS Code session paths, its slow-track `asked` guard spans worktree requests; choosing **Continue with snapshots** resets `asked` only when continued tracking returns a snapshot hash.

### Builds

Two separate esbuild builds in [`esbuild.js`](esbuild.js):

- **Extension** (Node/CJS): `src/extension.ts` → `dist/extension.js`
- **Webview** (browser/IIFE): `webview-ui/src/index.tsx` → `dist/webview.js` AND `webview-ui/agent-manager/index.tsx` → `dist/agent-manager.js`

### Non-Obvious Details

- Webview uses **Solid.js** (not React) — JSX compiles via `esbuild-plugin-solid`
- Extension code in `src/`, webview code in `webview-ui/src/` with separate tsconfig
- Tests compile to `out/` via `compile-tests`, not `dist/`
- CSP requires nonce for scripts and `font-src` for bundled fonts — see [`HarnessProvider.ts`](src/HarnessProvider.ts)
- HTML root has `data-theme="harness-vscode"` to activate harness-ui's VS Code theme bridge
- Extension and webview have no shared state — communicate via `vscode.Webview.postMessage()`
- For editor panels, use [`AgentManagerProvider`](src/agent-manager/AgentManagerProvider.ts) pattern with `retainContextWhenHidden: true`
- esbuild webview build includes [`cssPackageResolvePlugin`](esbuild.js) for CSS `@import` resolution and font loaders (`.woff`, `.woff2`, `.ttf`)
- Avoid `setTimeout` for sequencing VS Code operations — use deterministic event-based waits (e.g. `waitForWebviewPanelToBeActive()`)

## Extension ↔ Webview Feature Pattern

When adding a new feature that requires data from the CLI backend to be displayed in the webview:

1. **Types** (`src/services/cli-backend/types.ts`): Add response types for the backend data
2. **SDK Client** (`src/services/cli-backend/connection-service.ts`): Use the existing SDK client to retrieve the data
3. **Host Handler** (`src/harness-provider/` or the existing handler in `src/HarnessProvider.ts`): Handle the corresponding webview request using the existing cached message pattern
4. **Message Types** (`webview-ui/src/types/messages/`): Add `*LoadedMessage` (extension→webview) and `Request*Message` (webview→extension) types to the `ExtensionMessage` / `WebviewMessage` unions
5. **Context** (`webview-ui/src/context/`): Subscribe to the loaded message **outside** `onMount` (to catch early pushes before mount), add retry logic for the request message, expose state via context
6. **Component** (`webview-ui/src/components/`): Consume context, render UI

Key patterns:

- **Cached messages** (e.g. `cachedProvidersMessage`, `cachedAgentsMessage` in HarnessProvider): Ensures webview refreshes get data immediately without waiting for a new HTTP round-trip
- **Retry timers** (e.g. `agentRetryTimer` in session context): Handles race conditions where the extension's HTTP client isn't ready when the webview first requests data

## Agent Manager

The Agent Manager is a feature within this extension (not a separate product). It opens as an **editor tab** (`Cmd+Shift+M`) and provides multi-session orchestration — running multiple independent AI sessions in parallel, each optionally isolated in its own git worktree.

### How It Differs From the Sidebar

| Aspect | Sidebar | Agent Manager |
|---|---|---|
| Location | Activity bar sidebar panel | Editor tab (full panel) |
| Sessions | Single session at a time | Multiple parallel sessions with tabbed UI |
| Git isolation | Uses workspace root | Each session can get its own worktree branch |
| State | No dedicated state file | `.harness/agent-manager.json` |
| Terminals | None | Dedicated VS Code terminal per session |
| Setup scripts | None | Configurable `.harness/setup-script` runs per worktree |
| Multi-version | Not supported | Up to 4 parallel worktrees with the same prompt |

### Architecture

Agent Manager local worktree sessions use the current shared `harness serve` process owned by `HarnessConnectionService`; no session starts its own backend. Their CLI requests pass the worktree path as `directory`, which resolves directory-scoped backend state. Setup scripts, terminal PTYs, git subprocesses, and a separately opened VS Code window are separate process or extension-host boundaries, not per-worktree `harness serve` instances.

Extension-side code lives in `src/agent-manager/`, webview code in `webview-ui/agent-manager/`. The webview reuses the sidebar's provider chain and `ChatView` component, adding a `WorktreeModeProvider` and a split layout.

### Multi-project migration

Multi-project Agent Manager is an incremental migration behind the application-scoped `harness-code.experimental.multiProject` flag (default `false`); flag-off behavior must remain unchanged. The project registry/contexts, per-project state and session routing, project sidebar, sections and drag-and-drop, progress/persistence, and project-targeted worktree creation are implemented.

Current implementations are in [project/](src/agent-manager/project/) and [indexing-consent.ts](src/indexing-consent.ts). Check the code and tests before treating migration items as unfinished work. Review areas remain explicit project/worktree/session routing, immutable project-bound Settings, machine-local indexing consent, canonical Git identity, multi-window route ownership, shared sidebar convergence, and full two-project E2E/legacy-parity coverage.

## Webview UI (harness-ui)

New webview features must use **`@harness/harness-ui`** components instead of raw HTML elements with inline styles. This is a Solid.js component library built on `@kobalte/core`.

- Import via deep subpaths: `import { Button } from "@harness/harness-ui/button"`
- Available components include `Button`, `IconButton`, `Dialog`, `Spinner`, `Card`, `Tabs`, `Tooltip`, `Toast`, `Code`, `Markdown`, and more
- Provider composition is defined by `ProviderShell.Root`, `.Session`, and `.Chat` in [provider-shell.tsx](webview-ui/src/context/provider-shell.tsx); follow that implementation rather than a copied provider order.
- Global styles imported via `import "@harness/harness-ui/styles"` in [`index.tsx`](webview-ui/src/index.tsx)
- [`chat.css`](webview-ui/src/styles/chat.css) imports the focused stylesheets in [styles/](webview-ui/src/styles/). When replacing a component with harness-ui, remove obsolete rules from the owning stylesheet.
- Extension-specific CSS stays with its feature: chat styles under `webview-ui/src/styles/`, Agent Manager styles under `webview-ui/agent-manager/`. Reusable component styles belong in `packages/harness-ui/`.
- **Check existing webview usages first**: `webview-ui/src/` and `packages/harness-ui/src/stories/` show how harness-ui components are composed. Do not rely only on the component API in isolation.
- **`data-component` and `data-slot` attributes carry CSS styling** — harness-ui uses `[data-component]` and `[data-slot]` attribute selectors, not class names. Reuse existing component slots where available so shared styles apply consistently.
- **Prefer harness-ui styles**: Reuse existing harness-ui CSS variables, tokens, and component styles. Add missing reusable styles there; keep extension-specific rules in their owning feature stylesheet rather than inlining or duplicating styles.
- **Icons**: Harness-only icons are in [harness-ui's registry](../harness-ui/src/components/icon.tsx), which falls back to [the upstream registry](../ui/src/components/icon.tsx). To list upstream icon names: `node -e "const c=require('fs').readFileSync('../../packages/ui/src/components/icon.tsx','utf8');[...c.matchAll(/^\\s{2}[\"']?([\\w-]+)[\"']?:\\s*\x60/gm)].map(m=>m[1]).sort().forEach(n=>console.log(n))"`. Icon names use both hyphenated (`arrow-left`) and bare-word (`brain`, `console`, `providers`) keys.

### Diff Rendering Performance

- Preserve hunk-bounded unified `patch` data through Changes/review detail flows and pass patch-derived `FileDiffMetadata` to Pierre when available. Do not eagerly render Pierre from complete `before`/`after` contents based only on changed-line counts: a tiny patch in a large source file can otherwise parse and render the entire file while the user sees a placeholder.
- Pierre workers can offload highlighted updates, but they do not make an expensive synchronous initial render safe. Keep initial rendering hunk-bounded, and keep patch parsing behind deferred visibility/activation where session-switch responsiveness depends on it.
- When changing diff scheduling, verify both rapid session switching and fast scrolling through a review. Improving one by shifting work into the other is a regression, not an optimization.

## Debugging

- Extension logs: "Extension Host" output channel (not Debug Console)
- Webview logs: Command Palette → "Developer: Open Webview Developer Tools"
- In Chrome/VS Code performance traces, associate CPU `ProfileChunk` events to their `Profile.id` target before attributing work to a thread. `v8:ProfEvntProc` is a profile delivery thread, not evidence that application work ran off the webview main thread.
- All debug output must be prepended with `[Harness New]` for easy filtering

## Naming Conventions

- All VSCode commands must use `harness-code.` prefix (not `harness-code.`)
- All view IDs must use `harness-code.` prefix, **except** the sidebar view which uses `harness-code.SidebarProvider` to preserve user sidebar position when upgrading from the legacy extension

## Process Spawning (Windows)

On Windows, any `spawn`/`execFile`/`exec` call that does not set `windowsHide: true` will flash a cmd.exe console window at the user. To prevent this, **never import `spawn`, `execFile`, or `exec` from `child_process` directly**. Use the wrappers in `src/util/process.ts` instead — they enforce `windowsHide: true` automatically:

```ts
import { spawn, exec } from "../util/process"
```

The `spawn` wrapper covers long-lived processes (e.g. `harness serve`). The `exec` wrapper covers short commands (e.g. `git`, `tar`). If you need the raw callback form of `execFile` for some reason, pass `windowsHide: true` explicitly in the options object.

Agent Manager uses read-only `gh` commands for PR status and PR import. Call `execGhRead` from `src/agent-manager/gh.ts` for those commands; on Windows it supplies `TZ=UTC` when no timezone is configured, preventing older `gh` releases from launching `tzutil.exe` in a visible console.

## Style

Follow monorepo root AGENTS.md style guide:

- Prefer `const` over `let`, early returns over `else`
- Single-word variable names when possible
- Avoid `try`/`catch`, avoid `any` type
- ESLint rules live in [eslint.config.mjs](eslint.config.mjs); formatting follows the repository's Prettier configuration.

## File Size Caps (maxLines)

Large files in `src/agent-manager/` have `maxLines` caps enforced by `tests/unit/agent-manager-arch.test.ts`. **Do not raise these caps.** If adding a feature would exceed a cap, extract logic into a vscode-free helper module and call it from the provider. See `fork-session.ts` and `format-keybinding.ts` for examples of this pattern.

## Markdown Tables

Do not pad markdown table cells for column alignment. Use `| content |` with single spaces, not `| content       |` with extra padding. Padding creates spurious diffs. Markdown files are excluded from prettier (via `.prettierignore`) to prevent auto-reformatting of tables.
