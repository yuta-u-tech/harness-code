 * Delete orphaned directories under `.harness/worktrees/`.
 *
 * Every path is re-validated against a *fresh* reconcile — not the possibly-stale `ctx.report` the
 * dialog was built from — before it is touched, so a directory the worktree pool just claimed in the
 * meantime can never be deleted through this path even if the webview sends a stale selection.
 *
 * Runs behind `host.withProgress` so the caller (a webview message handler) returns immediately: the
 * dialog closes instantly, and the actual teardown + delete + snapshot cleanup happens in the
 * background. Cancelling stops the loop from starting new paths; a path already handed to
 * `detachOrphanDirectory` keeps reaping regardless, since the rename already happened.
 *
 * Size walking is paused for the whole delete and resumed after it. Sizing a folder that is about to
 * be renamed away is wasted I/O — potentially gigabytes of it — and the pass would be discarded on
 * arrival anyway. Resuming before the closing reconcile is what re-measures whatever is still there,
 * once, instead of once per deleted folder.
