 * actually found in the DOM, so a data/DOM count mismatch (e.g. content the
 * renderer collapses or reformats) still always highlights *something* in
 * the active row rather than silently highlighting nothing.
 *
 * `matchedParts` maps a row key to the part ids MessageList's data model
 * could attribute a match to there. A row with **no entry** has zero
 * data-level matches, so nothing in it is scanned at all — otherwise some
 * unindexed text (a static button label, a different non-matching part in
 * the same message) could get highlighted despite never being counted. A
 * row *with* an entry (even one with an empty part-id set, e.g. an
 * error/diff row with no per-part attribution) always has SOME genuine
 * match, so scanning falls back to the whole row whenever the part-scoped
 * DOM lookup doesn't resolve to anything mounted (a part id with no
 * `[data-part-id]` marker at all — e.g. user messages — or not yet
 * expanded) — that's a lookup failure, not a signal to scan nothing.
