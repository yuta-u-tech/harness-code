// Subprocess test for the abort of the abandoned piped-stdin read.
//
// Promise.race does not cancel its loser: before the abort (run-stdin.ts),
// Bun kept buffering stdin into the abandoned `Bun.stdin.text()` after the
// silence timer won — 64MB written by this harness grew the child by more
// than the write volume of native memory (37MB RSS at the timer, 151MB at
// exit). The timer now aborts the read and cancels the stdin stream, so the
// same write volume must leave the child's RSS flat.
//
// node:child_process (not Bun.spawn) so a write into the full or dead pipe
// surfaces as a catchable stream error instead of killing the harness.
