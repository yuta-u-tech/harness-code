/**
 * Source contract test for selectSession's connection handling.
 *
 * Static analysis — reads session.tsx and verifies that selectSession updates
 * the current session id BEFORE (and independently of) the backend connection
 * check, and only defers the message fetch when offline.
 *
 * Regression guard: previously selectSession bailed out entirely when
 * `server.isConnected()` was false. In Agent Manager the side diff is resolved
 * from the worktree selection independently of currentSessionID, so a switch
 * during a transient disconnect moved the diff but left the chat frozen on the
 * previous session ("switching only changes the sidebar diff"). The chat must
 * always follow the selection; only the network fetch may wait for reconnect.
