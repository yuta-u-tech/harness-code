/**
 * ProjectContext — immutable repository scope for Agent Manager.
 *
 * A context owns the repository-bound services that used to be singletons on
 * the provider: WorktreeStateManager, WorktreeManager, SetupScriptService,
 * plus stale-worktree tracking. Services are created lazily on first access
 * and never re-pointed at another root, so a context can never mix state
 * between repositories.
 *
 * Lifecycle policy:
 * - The pinned context is derived from the current VS Code workspace root and
 *   always exists while a folder is open. It is implicit and never persisted.
 * - Additional projects come from the ProjectRegistry. Their contexts are
 *   created on demand (expand/select), never eagerly at panel open.
 * - Only the active context gets full Git/PR polling; the pollers follow the
 *   active context through the provider's accessors.
 * - Non-pinned contexts require the multi-project flag before they can be
 *   expanded or activated.
