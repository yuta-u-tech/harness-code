/**
 * Right-side terminal wiring for the Agent Manager webview.
 *
 * Extracted from AgentManagerApp.tsx to keep that file under the
 * `max-lines` lint cap. Owns the destination preference plus the toggle
 * semantics: the toolbar button toggles visibility, while `Cmd/Ctrl+/`
 * reveals, focuses when unfocused, and hides when focused.
 * Hiding never kills the terminal — only the explicit close action does.
 *
 * ## Destination state ownership
 *
 * The VS Code setting is application-scoped, so one value is shared by
 * every window and echoed back via `terminal.destinationChanged`
 * whenever ANY window rewrites it. Two windows can therefore fight:
 * picking "VS Code terminal" in worktree window B would silently flip
 * the routing of the panel in window A. To keep each panel consistent,
 * an explicit dropdown pick is stored per panel (webview state) and
 * wins over remote echoes; the setting only drives panels that never
 * picked a destination themselves (it stays the default for new ones).
