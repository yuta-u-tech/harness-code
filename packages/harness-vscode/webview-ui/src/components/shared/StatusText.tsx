/**
 * StatusText
 *
 * The working indicator is a centered cluster, so replacing the status label
 * outright moved the spinner by half the width delta — a visible jump every time
 * the agent switched from reading to editing to writing a response.
 *
 * The label box is locked to the outgoing width, then released to the incoming
 * width, so the cluster glides to its new position instead of teleporting. The
 * outgoing label stays mounted for that one crossfade, and the incoming label
 * shimmers with the same treatment the edit and write tools use for a pending
 * title, so the row reads as one live element that is being rewritten.
